<img src="pic3.PNG" alt="Picture of SCNAV running on Windows 7" width="1286" height="741">
<h3>The Scan!!! page is simple and easy to use with its large buttons</h3>
<h1>1 - Qucick Scan</h1>
<p>that is purposly mis-spelled lmao</p>
<h3>The Qucick Scan button will start initiate a Scan in the C:\Windows Directory</h3>
<h1>Be aware that Qucick Scan may detect false positives</h1>
<h1>When you perform a scan this happens!</h1>
<h3>A UAC Permission Request Dialog Prompt may popup when you start a scan. Please grant scan.exe administraive perms apon request in order to scan</h3>
<h3>Once you accept the permission request SCNAV will start to initiate the scan!!!</h3>
<img src="pic5.PNG" alt="scan.exe" width="715" height="386">
<h3>As it shows in the picture SCAN.exe (The virus scanner) Will NOT Delete any files it detects as a threat</h3>
<h3>it simply writes a record containing the threats file location and filename in SCNAV's quarentine</h3>
<img src="pic6.PNG" alt="scan.exe scanning files" width="702" height="377">
<h3>As the scanner checks the hashes of all the files in the directory it will display the file its scanning on the screen</h3>
<h3>When it detecs a threat it will write information to a txt doucment in C:/Program Files/SCNAV2025/threats.txt and threatsexe.txt
<h3>This is SCNAV'S Quarentine</h3>
<h1>What happens after a Scan</h1>
<h3>After the virus scan has finished SCNAV will pop up saying "Scan Finished" And the scan Results button will appear!</h3>
<h3>Note: If you did a custom SCAN: The results button may show even while the scan is still in progress. Please make sure the scan has finished before entering the scan results page</h3>
<img src="pic8.PNG" alt="A button with a magnifyglass icon that says Results" width="188" height="77">
<h1>Scan results! page (A.K.A The Threat Removeal Page)</h1>
<img src="pic91.PNG" alt="Scan Results screen" width="1147" height="654">
<img src="pic92.PNG" alt="Scan Results screen" width="1147" height="654">
<h3>Here you can use delete the threats viruses and malware scnav has detected</h3>
<h3>If there were no threats detected. A large green lable will block the Delete and remove all detected threats button (Kinda like a Master arm cover!)</h3>
<h3>If there were threats detected in the previous scan. The Delete and remove all detected threats button will be available to click</h3>
<h3>First its recomended that you check what threats SCNAV has detected. Click the View Detected Threats button</h3>
<img src="pic10.PNG" alt="Scan Results screen" width="549" height="317">
<h3>If SCNAV did not detect any threats. you will get an error when clicking the button</h3>
<h3>This error means that threats.txt does not exist (therefore, there were no threats detected in the last scan)</h3>
<img src="pic11.PNG" alt="Scan Results screen" width="1230" height="666">
<h1>OK! now delete the malware it detected please!!!!</h1>
<h3>First slow down. Check to make sure that the "threats" detected are actually threats. This can be randomly named EXE files and many more etc</h3>
<h3>To delete all the detected threats off your computer: Very simply Click the Kill And Remove All Detected Threats button</h3>
<h3>This will open remove.exe -- SCNAV's virus remover</h3>
<h3>remove.exe will request admin permissions just like scan.exe</h3>
<h3>once accepted remove will first kill all Exe's detected as a threat Via Taskkill /f /im. This can stop actively running viruses Like the MEMZ trojan. and it can stop any RATs running on your system aswell</h3>
<h3>Once the threat is dead. It will attempt to delete the threat in 3 methods. Method 2 will most likely work Depending on your system hardware/software</h3>
<h1>If everything has succeded. The threat has been deleted! Thats it! Simple right?</h1>
